## [DisMech: A Discrete Differential Geometry-based Physical Simulator for Soft Robots and Structures](https://github.com/StructuresComp/dismech-rods)

[DisMech](https://github.com/StructuresComp/dismech-rods) is a discrete differential geometry-based physical simulator for elastic rod-like structures and soft robots.
Based on the [Discrete Elastic Rods](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/cg/pdfs/143-rods.pdf) framework, it can be used to simulate soft structures for a wide variety of purposes such as robotic deformable material manipulation and soft robot control.
