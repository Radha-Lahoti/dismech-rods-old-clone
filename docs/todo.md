## TODO

If you'd like DisMech to support a new feature, feel free create an issue and we'll add it to the list here.

#### High priority
- [ ] Add per-limb friction coefficient logic. PR [#5](https://github.com/StructuresComp/dismech-rods/pull/5)
- [ ] Add active entanglement example code.
- [ ] Add limb self-contact option.
- [ ] Add contact logic for joints.
- [ ] Add URDF functionality for instantiating robot.

#### Low priority
- [ ] Possibly replace floor contact force (currently uses IMC) with modified mass method. 
- [ ] Add detailed documentation for all examples.
- [ ] Add more code examples for initializing limbs and joints.
- [ ] Add time varying boundary condition logic.
- [ ] Add more controller types.
- [ ] Add shell functionality.

#### COMPLETED
- [x] Add forward Euler integration scheme.
- [x] Add contact logic for limbs.
